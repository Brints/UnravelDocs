  Email-Specific Styles for 'email-verification.html'
  ----------------------------------------------------
  The primary styling for HTML emails is handled by:
  1. Inline styles directly on HTML elements.
  2. A <style> block within the <head> of the HTML document.
  This is crucial for ensuring maximum compatibility across diverse email clients,
  as support for external stylesheets is limited and inconsistent.

  This external CSS file (`email-verification.css`) can be used for:
  - Styles that are non-critical if an email client strips external CSS.
  - A web-based preview of the email template, if such a preview exists.
  - General theming elements that might be shared if `base.css` is very generic.

  Note: Most of the visual presentation is defined within `email-verification.html`.
  The styles from the original `email-verification.css` (e.g., for `.lastName`)
  have been integrated into the HTML template's <style> block or applied inline
  for better email client rendering.
*/

/* Example: A very general body style if not covered by base.css or inline styles */
/*
body.email-preview {
    background-color: #e9ecef;
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
*/

/*
  The class `.lastName` from your original CSS is now handled by
  `<span class="user-name" style="font-weight: bold;" th:text="${lastName}">`
  within the HTML, ensuring the bold styling is applied reliably.
  The specific font size and color would also be best controlled via the
  <style> block in the HTML or inline styles for email purposes.
